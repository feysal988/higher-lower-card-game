# Higher / Lower Card Game

## How to Run
Run Main.java from IntelliJ.

## Game Modes
1. Higher or Lower - guess if the next card is higher or lower, with streak-based scoring and jokers.
2. Guess the Suit - guess the suit of the drawn card; jokers allow survival and reset streak.

## Design Decisions
Enums are used for suits and ranks.
Game rules are separated from game flow.
Deck handles card creation and shuffling.

## Improvements
GUI interface
Additional game modes
Jokers
Unit tests

## Added Features
Streak-based scoring system that rewards consecutive correct guesses.
Two Joker cards added to the deck which reset streaks and allow the player to continue.
